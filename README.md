# Card_Shuffler_Visualizer

This program, when finished, will show a graphical user interface displaying a visualization of different shuffling algorithms on a deck of cards.

At this time, I have programmed an initial shuffling algorithm in a Shuffler class, and a demonstration of the shuffle in a main file.
